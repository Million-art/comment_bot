# Comment Ban Bot

## What does this bot do?
This bot helps group admins keep their group chat clean. When someone (who is not an admin) sends a message in the group, the bot will automatically mute them. Admins are never muted. The bot works quietly in the background and does not send notifications when it mutes someone.

## How to set up the bot (for non-technical users)

1. **Get a bot token:**
   - Open Telegram and search for "BotFather".
   - Start a chat with BotFather and send the command `/newbot`.
   - Follow the instructions to create a new bot. BotFather will give you a token (a long string of letters and numbers). Copy this token.

 

2. **Add the bot to your group:**
   - Open your group chat in Telegram.
   - Tap the group name at the top, then "Add member".
   - Search for your bot (the name you gave it with BotFather) and add it to the group.
   - Make the bot an admin in your group (so it can mute users):
     - Tap the group name > "Administrators" > "Add Admin" > select your bot > give it permission to "Ban users".

3. **That's it!**
   - Now, whenever a non-admin user sends a message in the group, the bot will mute them automatically.
   - Admins can talk freely and will never be muted.
